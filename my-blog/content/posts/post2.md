~~The World Wide Web and the idea of a blog appeared at the same time.~~ Tim Berners-Lee, often described as the Web’s inventor, created the first “blog” in 1992 to outline and render visible the ongoing development of the Web and the software necessary to navigate this new space. Web history, especially the early growth of Web servers and sites, is chronicled on the various “What’s New” pages in the archives of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Another example of a blog that existed before the word was coined is Slashdot. Following its debut in September 1997, Slashdot operated as a clearinghouse for information in its “News for Nerds,” with a small set of editors who decided what to publish of numerous articles and news items submitted by the “geek” community. Indeed, Web sites mentioned on Slashdot were often overwhelmed, leading to a condition now known as being “slashdotted.”
