## My Blog 3
![pic3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FImage&psig=AOvVaw11Fm5WQmGEkEYP9F6KrVzS&ust=1646300272911000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCPC-9smQp_YCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAO)
_In December 1997, Jorn Barger, an early online presence, coined the term web log to describe his Web site RobotWisdom.com._ In early 1999 another individual with considerable online experience, Peter Merholz, began to employ the term blog on his site Peterme.com. While the history of the term is pretty well settled, the same cannot be said of the identity of the first blogger. Depending on the definition of a blog, Berners-Lee may not qualify as the first blogger. Claimants to this title include Justin Hall, a college student who started an online list at links.net in 1994; Carolyn Burke, who began publishing Carolynâ€™s Diary online in 1995; and Dave Winer, who has published Scripting News online since April 1, 1997.
