**The growth of the blogosphere has been nothing short of remarkable.** Technorati, Inc., a Web site and organization dedicated to mapping and searching the blogosphere, found that by October 2005 there were 19.6 million blogs, a number that has been doubling roughly every five months. Approximately 70,000 new blogs are created each dayâ€”or, more vividly, nearly one every second. Also of importance is the growth of blogs in languages other than English, especially Chinese.
